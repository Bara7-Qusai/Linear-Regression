## Linear Regression: A Comprehensive Guide

Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. Here's a detailed explanation of this topic:

### Basics
- **Model Equation**: In linear regression, the relationship between the independent variables (\(X\)) and the dependent variable (\(y\)) is represented by a linear equation:
  \[
  y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon
  \]
  where:
  - \(y\) is the dependent variable (target),
  - \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) are the independent variables (features),
  - \(\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n\) are the coefficients (parameters) that represent the slope of the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable,
  - \(\epsilon\) is the error term (residuals) representing the difference between the observed and predicted values.

### Steps to Apply Linear Regression
1. **Data Collection**: Obtain a dataset containing the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target).
2. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the data to understand its distribution and relationships between variables.
3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training**: Use the training data to estimate the coefficients (\(\beta\)) of the linear equation.
5. **Prediction**: Use the estimated coefficients to predict the dependent variable for new observations.
6. **Performance Evaluation**: Use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and \(R^2\) score to evaluate the model's performance.
